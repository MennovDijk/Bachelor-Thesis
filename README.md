# Bachelor Thesis
Code and other documents belonging to the bachelor thesis written by Menno van Dijk, titled "Twitter Sentiment on Trump and its Effect on Financial Markets". Supervised by prof. dr. van der Heijden

# Notes
This code is extremely messy throughout. In general the code is set-up as follows:
- obtain_data_xxx.py is used to pull live twitter data using the Twitter API (w/ Tweepy). I had to manually run this program every day to collect data (did not think of setting up a server to do this for me).
- The folder Thesis_Python contains all the code used to obtain the results of the thesis. Note that this won't currently work since I did not know of relative pathing at the time, this should be an easy fix, however. 
- Thesis Final Draft.docx is the final result of the thesis, which was subsequently graded with a 9.0
